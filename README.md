# dl4j-rnn-timeseries-examples
An example of DL4J's Recurrent Neural Networks applied to timeseries data

## Working with the PhysioNet Example

* git clone the repo
* update the schema as needed - https://github.com/jpatanooga/dl4j-rnn-timeseries-examples/blob/master/src/test/resources/physionet_schema.txt
* the system will automatically download PhysioNet data when it runs
* the outcomes / labels are already included in the repo
* tune the model by changing hyperparameters and running: https://github.com/jpatanooga/dl4j-rnn-timeseries-examples/blob/master/src/main/java/org/deeplearning4j/examples/rnn/strata/physionet/PhysioNet_LSTM_Model.java
